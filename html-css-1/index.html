    <p>The paragraph that was in the mockup made no sense to me.
        So I am writing something else here. Here is my attempt at this mock up. I don't really like the colors in this mockup but that 
    has nothing to do with how challenging I found this mockup to do. I chose this picture because I like elephants
and I think they are amazing creatures.</p>
